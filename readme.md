# Correlation Nation

This is my portfolio project for **CS 361: Software Engineering I**

This is a small web app designed to allow a user/researcher to show correlation between various country-level statistics via a scatter-plot graph. It pulls certain data from Wikipedia via a web-scraper microservice that converts HTML table data into JSON format in order to feed the data tables into the plotting component.
